# Leaderboard-App
An Interactive Leaderboard made with React frontend, and Node/Express backend. 

Queries are made to the Leauge of Legends API to rank users based on Player Level. 

API Key needs to be generated daily to access RIOT API. 

Massive thanks to all those who helped me along the way, especially Howard.
